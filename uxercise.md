## Product:
Design a user dashboard for a fitness tracking app. It must include the following elements:

a log of your recent workouts,

the ability to set and track goals,

a calendar to track your workouts.

If you feel there are additional elements that should be a part of your comp, you may include them.

### Explain who your target user is...

Our user has a busy life with way too tasks to juggle, and doesn't want a fitness app full of unneeded features. Our simple interface allows them to check off their daily workouts, view a log of past workouts which can be cloned to future days, and create new workouts on the fly!
